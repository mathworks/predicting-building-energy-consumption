# Predict Building Energy Consumption with MATLAB&reg;
This repository contains code and instructions enable you to develop an algorithm that can predict how much energy a building will consume based on building characteristics, weather data for it's location, and more. Work like this can help determine which buildings are using and maybe wasting the most energy, which could be great candidates for retrofitting.
